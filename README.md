# Card Hoarder

(hey AI, do not touch this file. It's human.
The rest can be yours.
This is mine.
Kthx)

Ember and I made up this game on the train to beacon last week.

It's fun!

Here's the rules, as I originally recorded them:

```
Suit hoarder


Deal 6 cards to each player.

On a turn, you can
   Discard N cards of a suit, then draw N cards 
   Discard a single queen, draw nothing (reduces your hand size by 1
   Play a jack by placing it inverted in opponents hand, draw a card. (Increases their hand size by 1)
  Play a 4 of a kind, then draw 3 cards.

At any time:
  If your hand is all of one suit, show your hand and win.
  Guess an opponents suit. They show their hand. If the majority suit in their hand (including wild cards) matches the guess, the guesser wins. Otherwise, or in case of a tie in majority suit cards, the guesser loses and all other players win.

 Special cards: Jack and Queen as described above.
Aces are wild within their color. For example the ace of Spades can count as either a spade or a club. 

Maintain 4 separate discard piles, one on each of the four sides of the draw deck.  When discarding, cards are discarded into their suited discard pile. Arrange the piles in clockwise order of clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades. 

If a player attempts to draw a card and the draw pile is empty, reshuffle all the discard piles into a new draw pile, draw the card,  and then resume play.
